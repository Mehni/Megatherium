# Megatherium

Restores the inferior Megasloth back to its former Megatherium glory.

Back in the olden days when the world was still flat, there was this majestic creature called Megatherium that lumbered across the plains. Their name instilled a sense of fear and respect in those that saw it.

Then A16 came and the mighty megatherium had its name changed to megasloth. And that just isn't as cool, because it's a mundane megasloth. Sloths sometimes miss the branch they're aiming for and fall out of trees. Megatheriums would never do that, they'd fell the tree and eat it whole.

This purely cosmetic mod changes the megasloth name back to megatherium.
